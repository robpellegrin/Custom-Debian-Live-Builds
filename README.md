# Custom Debian Live Builds Repository

Welcome to the Custom Debian Live Builds repository! This project contains a collection of tailored Debian live environments designed for specific use cases, including but not limited to high-performance computing with OpenMPI.

## Overview

Debian Live allows users to create a live operating system that can be run from a USB drive, CD/DVD, or over the network. Our custom builds aim to provide lightweight and efficient environments for various applications, making it easy to deploy systems quickly and effectively.

## Prerequisites

- A Debian or Debian based system for building.
- Root privileges.
- A USB drive large enough to hold the built image.
- `live-build` installed on your system.

```bash
sudo apt install live-build
```

For more information on how to use `live-build`, please refer to the [official documentation](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/live-build/live-build.1.en.html).
